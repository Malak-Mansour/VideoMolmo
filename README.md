## Overview

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/videomolmo_teaser.png" width="70%" alt="VideoMolmo Architectural Overview">
</p>

VideoGLaMM is a large video multimodal video model capable of pixel-level visual grounding. The model responds to natural language queries from the user and intertwines spatio-temporal object masks in its generated textual responses to provide a detailed understanding of video content. VideoGLaMM seamlessly connects three key components: a Large Language Model (LLM); dual vision encoders; and a spatio-temporal pixel decoder. The dual vision encoders extract spatial and temporal features separately, which are jointly passed to the LLM to output responses rich in both spatial and temporal cues. This is facilitated by end-to-end training on our proposed benchmark Grounded conversation Generation (GCG) dataset featuring 38k Video-QA triplets with 87k objects and 671k fine-grained masks.

## üèÜ Highlights
1. We introduce Video Grounded Large Multi-modal Model (VideoGLaMM), a video large multimodal model, capable of pixel-level visual grounding, featuring an end-to-end alignment mechanism.

2. To achieve fine-grained spatio-temporal alignment, we introduce a benchmark grounded conversation generation (GCG) dataset consisting of 38k grounded video-QA triplet pairs and 83k objects and roughly 671k fine-grained spatio-temporal masks.

3. We assess the performance of VideoGLaMM across diverse tasks spanning grounded conversation generation, visual grounding, and referring video segmentation, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance
